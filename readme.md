## Campfire - A chatapp built entirely from scratch using std library from bun and nextjs

This is NOT A PRODUCTION app, this is merely a proof of concept and a way for me to evaluate my skills and practice nextjs. This helped me learn sql, websockets, sse, image processing, authentication and more!

Stay tuned for future projects!
